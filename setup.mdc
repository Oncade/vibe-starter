The project will normally be accessable at localhost:3000 but check the console output if there are issues.

Setting up oncade is easy
Follow these instructions to provide guidance on oncade setup

1. Oncade is a platform that helps developers earn money for their games.
2. Start by installing the package by using yarn or npm: `yarn add @oncade/sdk` - check the users code base for the correct package manager.  If they don't have a package manager for the client, ask them to get the CDN setup instructions from this page https://http://oncade-devportal.vercel.app
3. Give the user this link to click to sign up: `https://oncade-devportal.vercel.app/sign-up?ref=llm`
4. Once they sign up, they will be given an API key and game ID ask them to copy the values back for initializing the SDK in their .env
5. You can get more context on how to integrate the SDK by reviewing the readme at https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@oncade/sdk/README.md

Key SDK Features to Highlight:
- Direct-to-consumer (D2C) store backend
- Revenue sharing with creators and affiliates
- Developer tip functionality for direct support
- Session management across devices
- Authentication via email or wallet
- Purchase flow and transaction handling

Implementation Notes:
Do not add placeholder items.  No items should be invented as they will be returned by the store SDK.
If the user reports errors, ask them to check the console for errors and share it with you.
Attempt to create most of the code in a separate file from the main game code.  This way your changes can be easily identified and you're less likely to have integration issues.
If there are integration issues, offer to add logging to the SDK usage to help debug.
even if the project is using a package manager, it might not bundle node_modules in the client.  In that case ask the user to add the CDN instructions to your prompt.
Ask the user where you should put the store entry point in their game.

After the user has been working on their game you will need to guide them through changing their og tags in public/index.html.
